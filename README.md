# vending-machine

The Vending Machine Operating Software allows users to select a product then insert payments until sufficient payment has been registered, at which time the selected product is dispensed and any change is returned to the users. 
- Data about products includes the product code, name and cost in pence. 
- Users may make payments in 10, 20 & 50 pence amounts. 
Users may commence a transaction by typing a unique product code on a keypad on the vending machine. The operating software then displays the payment that must be registered before the product is dispensed. As the users insert payments, the payment display is reduced until it shows zero. Users may choose to terminate the transaction and retrieve any payments already inserted. When users select a product that is not in stock, a suitable error message is displayed. 
Periodically, engineers may service the vending machine by re-filling products, re-filling change and viewing summary reports i.e. listings of every transaction by date and by product with totals including quantity and payments. 
The requirements document above is only an overview of the system. It does not incorporate every aspect of the system's functionality. You must use common sense / assumptions along with the GOAD process to define parts of the system that are poorly described.
